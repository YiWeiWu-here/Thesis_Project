### Problems or shortcuts in related researches

1. **Clock drifts/skew** based on phase-based ranging. -->  biased range estimation
2. Narrowband radio constraints of the nodes based on ultra-wideband (UWB) signals

### Method

#### Theory/basement：

The data matrix is rank one and that its principal singular vectors have a **shift invariance property** which enables **joint estimation of the clock-skew and range**.

#### Assumption:

1. The nodes are equipped with narrowband radio transceivers allowing two-way communication.

2. All the nodes have the same frequency synthesizer with a set of $K$ **equispaced gains** deﬁned as $G^{(k)}=G^{(1)}+(k-1)\Delta G,k=1,...,K$
3. We assume that the proposed estimators are approximately unbiased for sufﬁciently large SNR and well designed measurement matrix $M$.

#### Model(work)：

A matrix whose **rows collect measurements** acquired on the **same carrier frequencies** but **different time epochs** is constructed.

$\mathbf{v}_0=\mathbf{v}_1(1+\eta_0)$

$\eta_0$ Is the clock-skew of the sensor node, while $\mathbf{v}_0$ and $\mathbf{v}_1$ are the frequencies of the oscillator signals at the sensor and anchor node.

**$d_{01}=d_{10}=\lVert \mathbf{x_1-x_0} \rVert_2$**

##### Frequency synthesizer model

Clock signal of the local oscillator --> frequency synthesizer --> generate carrier signal

​                                                                 Change gain of the divider in fs --> generate different $f_c$

According to 2nd assumption, $f_i^{(k)}=G^{(k)}\mathbf{v}_i$, $i=0,1$

##### Signal model

The carrier frequency offset:

#### Algorithm

SVD

weighted least squares（WLS）

the shift invariance of the **left singular vector** -->the **range estimate**

the shift invariance of the **right singular vector** --> the **clockskew estimate**

#### Objective

Estimate the unknown parameters $\eta_0$ and $d_{01}$

#### Protocol (work)

1. Classical PDoA ranging protocol:

it is assumed that Δt is **ﬁxed** during the recollection of the measurements.

Problem: 

Exchange message over equispaced $f_c$ while $\Delta t$ is fixed

clock-skew --> biased estimation of $\tau_{01}$ from $\mathbf{a}(\tau_n)$

2. 2-D PDoA ranging and synchronization protocol

![截屏2021-01-18 11.34.43](/Users/joycewu/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/截屏2021-01-18 11.34.43.png)

Collect data over 2D set of equispaced time slots and $f_c$

During a single two-way message exchange **no carrier frequency switching** occurs.

3. 2-D equispaced time-frequency grid at anchor node

> Note: There is no constraint on the frequency hopping sequence.

> Note that ﬁrst the **clock-skew is estimated** and later this estimate is **used for the estimate of the range**.

#### Result

Assessment :  derive the CRLB

Simulation :

1. We consider **two nodes**, which are deployed **randomly** within a range of **140m**.

2. $\Delta f_i=0.5MHz,\Delta t=80\mu s,\eta_0=80ppm$

> a. The proposed algorithm **outperforms** the approximate iterative quadratic maximum-likelihood (AIQML) [21], weighted linear predictor (WLP) [24] and ESPRIT [10] for both clock-skew and range. Furthermore, for **sufﬁciently high SNR** the proposed algorithm is asymptotically efﬁcient and **approaches the theoretical bounds**, i.e. the CRLB.
>
> b. It is shown that by **increasing the number** of PDoA measurements collected over time epochs **the accuracy** of the **clock-skew estimates** is **increased**, while the **accuracy of the range** estimates **increases with N**.
>
> c. In all scenarios the **number of time and frequency hops is equal**. The proposed algorithm **outperforms** AIQML, WLP and ESPRIT. In addition, it can be seen that the proposed estimator **achieves the CRLB**.

#### Conclusion

a. A novel and precise data model for PDoA measurements is derived.  We have proposed a novel protocol for collection of PDoA measurements and an algorithm based on WLS to jointly estimate the clock-skew and range. Based on the shift invariance properties of principal singular vectors of the collected measurements. The estimator reaches the CRLB for sufﬁciently high SNR.

b. This paper jointly consider and analyze the clock-skew and range. Establish the data model. Have a good command of the two-way protocol.
